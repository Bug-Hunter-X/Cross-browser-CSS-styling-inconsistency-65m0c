# Cross-Browser CSS Styling Inconsistency

This repository demonstrates a peculiar CSS styling issue where an element is styled inconsistently across different web browsers.  The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS code.  The `bugSolution.css` provides a solution to ensure consistent styling across browsers.

## Bug Description
The element with the ID `myElement` should have a blue background and a width of 200px.  This works as expected in Chrome, but in Firefox, the element lacks the background color and takes on its default width.

## Solution
The solution in `bugSolution.css` addresses the cross-browser inconsistency.
